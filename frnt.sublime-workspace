For example, this abbreviation:\n  \n  ul#nav>li.item$*4>a{Item $}\n  \n  ...can be expanded into:\n  \n  <ul id=\"nav\">\n      <li class=\"item1\"><a href=\"\">Item 1</a></li>\n      <li class=\"item2\"><a href=\"\">Item 2</a></li>\n      <li class=\"item3\"><a href=\"\">Item 3</a></li>\n      <li class=\"item4\"><a href=\"\">Item 4</a></li>\n  </ul>\n  \n  Read more about Emmet for Sublime Text:\n  https://github.com/emmetio/sublime-text-plugin#readme\n"
